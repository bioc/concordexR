  abstract = "Dimensionality reduction is standard practice for filtering noise
              and identifying relevant dimensions in large-scale data analyses.
              In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin
              with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce `all-in-one'
              visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these
              are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative analysis
              of cell relationships. However, there is little theoretical
              support for this practice. We examine the theoretical and
              practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of
              single-cell data, and find extensive distortions incurred on the
              global and local properties of biological patterns relative to
              the high-dimensional, ambient space. In lieu of this, we propose
              semi-supervised dimensionality reduction to higher dimension, and
              show that such targeted reduction guided by the metadata
              associated with single-cell experiments provides useful latent
              space representations for hypothesis-driven biological discovery.
